# Stock Watch
A responsive web application built using AngulaJS 1.x and ASP.Net MVC 5.0 that allows public company stock lookup and query.

# Description
In a quest to explore and learn Angular JS framework I set out to create this single page application. Apart from Angular JS framework, this application also uses Bootstrap for UI layouts. I used Bower (client-side package manager) to install and reference Angular JS and Bootstrap libraries in the main page. 

# Azure Deployment
I used Azure Web Apps to deploy this application over to my personal Azure account. On every code check-in the application gets deployed to Azure. The application can be accessed by navigating to the following URL - https://stockwatchapp.azurewebsites.net/
